			<h1>Programming Enthusiast</h1>
			Hello, there. My name, if you hadn't guessed it already, is Jason. I am a programming enthusiast.<br/><br/>
			If there is a piece of software
			that I can create to solve a problem or make a task easier then I will endeavour to do so. Even if that means I have to learn a new language.
			<br/><br/>Because, let's face it. Each language is suited to a specific set of needs and sometimes it's too much hassle to code 'close to the machine' as it were,
			using a high-level language.
			<h1 style="text-align:right">Born in England, 1995</h1>
			I had a great up-bringing. None of my family were/are University graduates and none of them were interested in software.
			<br/><br/>
			I was born in Warrington, England and then swiftly moved onto London, England. Apparently I had a funny northerner accent which was quickly replaced by a southerner accent.
			I now speak in a, what I like to call, hybrid accent as my wife is American. 
			<h1>University Graduate</h1>
			One of very few accolades...
			<h1 style="text-align:right">The Problem Solver</h1>
			Ah yes, the bread and butter of my existence. The reason why I lay my fingers across my keyboard and type curly braces and jargon that makes no sense in an English sentence.
			<br/><br/>
			The thing that I enjoy most about software development is that it presents you with problems. Most of the time, these problems stem from previously written algorithms that we never account for.
			I love these problems because it is what makes perfect code perfect...In the end. And, it's a driving force, it's why I shoot up out of bed some nights; because I've thought of the solution.
